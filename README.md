$ cd inheritance <br/>
inheritance/ $ ./inheritance<br/>
Child (Generation 0): blood type AA

    Parent (Generation 1): blood type AB
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type AO         
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type OB         
    Parent (Generation 1): blood type OA      
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type OO 
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type AA
