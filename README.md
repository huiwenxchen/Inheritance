# Inheritance

This program is a simulation of the inheritance of blood type in a family.

To run the program. execute $ ./inheritance in the terminal. When the program compiles successfully, a randomly generated inheritance pattern in the family should be demonstrated in the terminal.

An example is below:

$ cd inheritance <br/>
inheritance/ $ ./inheritance<br/>
Child (Generation 0): blood type AA <br/>
    Parent (Generation 1): blood type AB<br/>
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type AO<br/>    
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type OB    <br/>   
    Parent (Generation 1): blood type OA    <br/>
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type OO<br/>    
        Grandparent (Generation 2): blood type AA<br/>
